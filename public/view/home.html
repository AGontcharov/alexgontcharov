			<h3>About me!</h3>
			<p> Currently in my 4th year of Software Engineering at the University of Guelph. I have a strong passion for coding, tangible projects, and reusable software. However, you'll often find me outdoor on land or in the water. </p>

			<p> Growing up I had the privilege of living in different countries. Raised in the historical city of Moscow but soon after moved to the west coast of Canada, British Columbia. My family settled on the outskirts of Vancouver, in a place called Burnaby where I developped many hobbies such as, skiing, hiking, soccer (Go Gunners!), and swimming.</p>

			<p> Graduating from elementary school I moved with my family to the sub-tropical islands of Bermuda, which I now call home. Enrolling in the prestigious Bermuda High School I was able to graduate with an international baccalaureate degree. </p>

			<p> In Bermuda I discovered my love for scuba diving. Starting an internship with Blue Water Divers <a href="https://www.divebermuda.com"> (www.divebermuda.com) </a> from 2010 to 2014. I quickly progressed through the PADI certified levels from Open water Diver all the way to Divemaster learning valuble social and teamwork skills along the way.</p>
