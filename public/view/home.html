			<h3>About me!</h3>
			<p> Currently in my 4th year of Software Engineering at the University of Guelph. As a student who's about to graduate I have a great passion for coding and creating tangible projects, as well as a great interest in the great outdoors! On land or in the water. </p>

			<p> Born and raised in Russia, in the historical city of Moscow until finally moving to the west coast of Canada, British Columbia at a young age. Settling on the outskirts of Vancouver city, in a city called Burnaby I developped a great many hobbies such as, skiing, hiking, soccer (Go Gunners!), and swimming. </p>

			<p> Graduating from The Elementary School of Marlborough I then moved with my family to the sub-tropical islands of Bermuda, which I now call my home and where my career in scuba diving started. </p>
