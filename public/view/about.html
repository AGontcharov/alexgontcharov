						<p>Recently graduated Software Engineer at the University of Guelph. I have a strong passion for coding, tangible projects, and reusable software. However, you'll often find me outdoor - on land or in the water.</p>

						<p>Growing up I had the privilege of living in different countries. Raised in the historical city of Moscow but soon after that, I moved to the west coast of Canada, British Columbia. My family settled on the outskirts of Vancouver, in a place called Burnaby where I developped many hobbies such as, skiing, hiking, swimming, and soccer (Go Gunners!).</p>

						<p>After Graduating from elementary school I moved with my family to the sub-tropical islands of Bermuda, which I now call home. By enrolling in the prestigious Bermuda High School I was able to graduate with an international baccalaureate degree and apply to the University of Guelph.</p>

			<h3>Discovering a New World</h3><br>
			<div class="scuba-description">
				<p>In Bermuda I discovered my love for scuba diving and started an internship with Blue Water Divers <a href="https://www.divebermuda.com"> (www.divebermuda.com) </a> from 2010 to 2014. I quickly progressed through the PADI certified levels from Open water Diver all the way to Divemaster learning valuble social and teamwork skills along the way. In the summer of 2014 I took the Instructor Development Course (IDC) with Ocean Divers <a href="https://www.oceandivers.com/"> (www.oceandivers.com) </a> and completed the Instructor Examination (IE) receiving my PADI Open Water Scuba Instructor certificate!</p>

				<p>The following two summers I was fortunate enough to work for Dive Bermuda <a href="https://www.bermudascuba.com/"> (www.bermudascuba.com)</a>, Bermuda's only PADI 5 Star Instructor Development Center. Alternating between their Grotto Bay and Southampton location, I was able to teach and introduce new divers the joy and excitement of the underwater world they're yet to discover.</p><br>
